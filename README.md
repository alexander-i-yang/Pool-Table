# Pool-Table
BellyPizza Inc. Project
## Prerequisites
This project requries the GLFW libary. It is a monster to set up but you need it anyway. Good luck.
Also, you should probably be using CLion. If you're not using CLion, you could still set it up, but I won't be able to help you when you do.
### Download
Download the library here.
### Move
Extract the zip file and put it in your CLion Project. The directory hierarchy should look something like this:
```
 - MyProject
   - c-make-build-debug
   - lib (The library you downloaded)
     - Common
     - Distrib
     - External
   - Ball.cpp
   - Ball.h
   - etc.
 ```
 ### Run
 It is absolutely critical that you use the `CMakeLists.txt` file on Github. If you don't, and you come to me with non-working code, I will smite you.
